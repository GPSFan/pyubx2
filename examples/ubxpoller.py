ubxpoller.py

This example illustrates how to read, write and display UBX messages
"concurrently" using threads and queues. This represents a useful
generic pattern for many end user applications.

It implements two threads which run concurrently:
1) an I/O thread which continuously reads UBX data from the
receiver and sends any queued outbound command or poll messages.
2) a process thread which processes parsed UBX data - in this example
it simply prints the parsed data to the terminal.
UBX data is passed between threads using queues.

Press CTRL-C to terminate.

FYI: Since Python implements a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL),
threads are not strictly concurrent, though this is of minor
practical consequence here. True concurrency could be
achieved using multiprocessing (i.e. separate interpreter
processes rather than threads) but this is non-trivial in
this context as serial streams cannot be shared between
processes. A discrete hardware I/O process must be implemented
e.g. using RPC server techniques.
